 * Participants were Keegan Evans, Constance LeBerth, Dauris Little, and Prof. Adams
 * 
 * \section design_sec Design
 *
 * Taskmaster was created using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a> pattern.
 * Students worked together to design the Model, and then divvied up the work
 * of implementing the methods of the Model classes. Prof Adams assembled the
 * View (user interface) and the Controller class.
 *
 * Code was shared via <a href="https://github.com/b-adams/Wells_Sp12_CS132_Project">this Github-hosted</a> <a href="http://git-scm.com/about/">Git</a> repository. Repositories were accessed
 * using the built-in Source Control features of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> (4.2) and the free Git 
 * client <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>
